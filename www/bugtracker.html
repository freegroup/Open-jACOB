<h2>Bugs and Enhancements ONLY.</h2>
The Bug Tracker is not a support or trouble ticket system. It is intended for the formal tracking 
of defects and enhancement request relating to the <i><b>Open-jACOB</b></i> software product. 
If you wish to make general inquiries please do not enter these in the Bug Tracker as they 
will be deleted. General support is offered through the online Forums.

<h2>The basics: what you did, what you wanted to happen, and what actually happened.</h2>

Those are the three basic elements of a bug report. You need to tell us 
exactly what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

<h2>Always search the bug database first.</h2>

There are many users of Open-jACOB. The odds are that if you've found 
a problem, someone else has found it, too. If you spend a few minutes of your time 
making sure that you're not filing the same bug, that's a few more minutes 
someone can spend helping to fix that bug rather than sorting out duplicate 
bug reports.

<h2>If you don't understand an error message, ask for help.</h2>

Don't report an error message as a bug if you don't understand it. There are many 
places where you can ask for help to understand what is going on before you can 
claim that an error message you do not understand is a bug ( ie. the Forums )

<h2>Be brief, but don't leave any important details out.</h2>

This is a fine line to walk. But there are some general guidelines:
<ul>
	<li>Remember the three basics: what you did, what you expected to happen, and what happened.</li>
	<li>When you provide code that demonstrates the problem, it should almost never be 
	    more than ten lines long. Anything longer probably contains a lot of code that has 
	    nothing to do with the problem, which makes it more difficult to figure out the real problem.</li>
	<li>If the product is crashing, include a trace log or stack dump ( be sure to copy and paste all of 
	    the cryptic error codes and line numbers included in the results )</li>
</ul>	  
<h2>Don't report bugs in old versions.</h2>
Every time a new version of <i><b>Open-jACOB</b></i> is released, many bugs are fixed. If you're using a version 
of a product that is more than two revisions older than the latest version, you should upgrade to 
the latest version to make sure the bug you are experiencing still exists.

<h2>Only report one problem in each bug report.</h2>
If you have encountered two bugs that don't appear to be related, create a new bug report for each one. 
This makes it easier for different people to help with the different bugs.

If you feel you understand the above criteria, please follow the link below:
