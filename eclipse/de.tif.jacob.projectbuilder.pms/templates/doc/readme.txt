  '{applicationName}' is a audit management system 'Starter Kit' for business processes. 
  
	Starter Kits are basically everything you need to do a project, though you'll need to do the 
	customization. It's a lot like buying off-the-shelf software and needing to customize it to suit your 
	needs. Now it is your turn to create a feature rich application with this.

  What is an Audit?
  -----------------
  An audit is a systematic examination used to determine whether or not an object meets previously 
  specified requirements, and is usually performed using question lists. The results of an audit are
  valuated and documented. Open-jACOB Audit Management helps you plan and process audits, monitor 
  corrective and preventive actions that were determined during audits, and evaluate audit data 
  according to different criteria.
